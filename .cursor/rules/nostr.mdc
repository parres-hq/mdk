# Nostr Protocol References

## NIP repo

The nostr [NIPs repo](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) is the official home of all nostr specs.

## Nostrbook MCP

You should have access to the Nostrbook MCP server that you can use to query the NIPs repo in a more structured way. If you don't have access to this you should prompt the user to install it with the following snippet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nostr": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@nostrbook/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
