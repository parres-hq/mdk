# Marmot Protocol

This library is an implementation of the Marmot Protocol. It aims to implement the spec fully and accurately.

## What is Marmot?

Marmot is a protocol that brings together the MLS (Messaging Layer Security) Protocol and Nostr protocol to do secure messaging over Nostr's distributed relay network.

You can find all the protocol specs in the /marmot workspace folder. Please ensure that all the code you are writing is on spec and always ask clarifying questions if part of the spec is unclear to you (we write the spec as well so we need to ensure that it's as clear and understandable as possible)

## Running tests on optional features

We have several feature flags in this repository. You often need to run test using feature flags. For example, the tests for `encrypted_media` need to be run with the `mip04` feature flag.
