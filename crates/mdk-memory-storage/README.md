# Nostr MLS Memory Storage

Memory-based storage implementation for [Nostr MLS](../nostr-mls). This crate provides a storage backend that implements the `MdkStorageProvider` trait from the [mdk-storage](../mdk-storage) crate.

## Features

- Uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) caching mechanism to store data in memory
- Provides both read and write operations that are thread-safe through `parking_lot::RwLock`
- Configurable cache size (default: 1000 items)
- Non-persistent storage that is cleared when the application terminates

## Performance

This implementation uses `parking_lot::RwLock` instead of the standard library's `std::sync::RwLock` for improved performance. The `parking_lot` implementation offers several advantages:

- Smaller memory footprint
- Faster lock acquisition and release
- No poisoning on panic
- More efficient read-heavy workloads, which is ideal for this caching implementation
- Consistent behavior across different platforms

## Example Usage

```rust,ignore
use mdk_memory_storage::MdkMemoryStorage;
use mdk_storage_traits::MdkStorageProvider;

// Create a new memory storage instance
let storage = MdkMemoryStorage::default();

// Or create with a custom cache size
let custom_storage = MdkMemoryStorage::with_cache_size(100);
```

For more advanced usage examples, see the tests in the source code.

## Changelog

## State

**This library is in an ALPHA state**, things that are implemented generally work but the API will change in breaking ways.
